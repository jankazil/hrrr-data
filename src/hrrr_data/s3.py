"""
Tools for operations on HRRR data files (in GRIB format) on S3 (Amazon Simple Storage System).

S3 does not have a true directory structure.

Each object in S3 is stored as a key-object pair, where:

The key is a unique string that identifies the object (like a file path).

In this module, we refer to the "keys" as "paths", and they are relative to the NOAA HRRR bucket.
